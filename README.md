# QuakeLog Parser

## Overview

The QuakeLog Parser is a Node.js application that parses logs generated by a Quake 3 Arena server. It uses Express to provide a web interface to view the parsed data. The application runs a server that listens on `http://localhost:3000/data`.

## Features

- Parses Quake 3 Arena log files.
- Groups game data by each match.
- Collects and reports kill data for each player.
- Provides a ranking of players based on kills.
- Generates a report of deaths grouped by death cause.
